# Gesture Controlled Bot

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a gesture-controlled robot. The project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to control a robot using hand gestures detected by a camera.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** The system utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures and convert them into commands for controlling the robot.

- **Real-time Control:** The robot responds in real-time to the detected hand gestures.

- **Multi-Gesture Support:** The system supports multiple gestures, allowing users to perform different actions such as moving forward, backward, turning left or right, and stopping the robot.


## Prerequisites

Before running the system, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Arduino IDE (for uploading code to the robot)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmarjeetMohanty/Gesture-Controlled-Bot.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Gesture-Controlled-Bot
   ```

3. Upload the Arduino code (`gesture_controlled_bot.ino`) to the Arduino board connected to the robot.

4. Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB.
